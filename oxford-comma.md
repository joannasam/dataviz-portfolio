# The Visualization 

![Oxford Comma](Oxford Comma.png)

This data visualization is from the article [“Elitist, Superfluous, Or Popular? We Polled Americans on the Oxford Comma”](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/elitist-superfluous-or-popular-we-polled-americans-on-the-oxford-comma/) on the website [FiveThirtyEight](https://abcnews.go.com/538). It is based on the [comma-survey dataset](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/comma-survey/comma-survey.csv).

The intent of the article is to explore the demographics of Oxford comma users vs. non-users.

# Observations about the visualization

## What works
The visualization is straightforward and fairly truthful. It makes sense that it intends to have a clear binary structure - both in terms of structure of the visual as well as the choice of colors.

## What does not work
The visualization misses the point of the article. It does not uncover any meaningful insight in the data, but instead is merely used to support a single argument (i.e. Oxford comma users think they have better grammar, and tend to be zealous). Essentially, the information presented is not compelling nor significant. It does not fully support the premise of the article. One glance at the data is enough to realize the missed opportunity to tell a full, well-rounded story - both by picking better attributes, as well as by drawing better comparisons. The bar chart is poorly executed and not intuitive - creating too much eye travel in order to draw a binary comparison. It would have made more sense to have a single chart with vertical columns side-by-side. Additionally, the headline lacks insight. Aesthetically, the visualization is underwhelming and uninteresting. Overall, it is incomplete - there is a lot more information in the underlying dataset.

# Primary audience

This article is quite niche and posted on a data visualization blog. The intended audience is likely someone who is either very curious and/or opinionated about the Oxford comma. They are also likely data-oriented and seeking data points to support their opinion. A reader would like to understand "where they stand" on the data spectrum of Oxford comma demographics. "Where do I fit into this picture?" "Who really is the average Oxford comma user/non-user?" This visual does little to answer those questions. It does not present any compelling insights, nor does it satisfy the reader's curiosity.
At the end of the day, the reader has an opinion and would like to see a binary comparison to know where they stand.

# Evaluation
In comparison to the Good Charts method, this Effectiveness Profile does not derive as many "reactions" and gut feelings. Examining a visualization is an intuitive and iterative process - the eye is drawn to certain information first.
However, this method derives a more complete and quantitative assessment of a visualization. This may be helpful when ranking or comparing the quality of visualizations.
