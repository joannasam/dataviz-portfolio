# About me
Hi! I'm Joanna Sam.

I'm currently a second-year Master of Information Systems Management - Business Intelligence & Data Analytics (MISM-BIDA) Graduate Student at Carnegie Mellon University. 

Prior to graduate school, I completed my undergraduate study in Computer Engineering. Following graduation, I worked for two years as a Business
Technology Analyst at the consulting firm ZS Associates - developing technology solutions for clients in the Pharmaceutical industry. My work consisted of leveraging Python, Hadoop and PySpark to build reports & dashboards, setting up ETL processes for KPI metrics, and analyzing Pharmaceutical datasets panning across data vendors to derive insights and drive customer value.

This summer, I interned as a Data Analyst & Consultant at the Chicago-based startup Hamatha LLC - catering to clients in the Energy Grants and Robotics fields, respectively. I am passionate about data and look forward to opportunities in Data Analytics, Data Engineering and Technology Consulting.

# What I hope to learn
Here are some of the things I would like to learn from this class - 

- Crafting compelling visualizations that uncover valuable insights from the data
- Analyzing and evaluating data visualizations for clarity and effectiveness
- Leveraging design principles to communicate clearly and powerfully
