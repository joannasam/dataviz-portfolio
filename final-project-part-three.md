# Developing The Story

For this project, I selected datasets that described mental health struggles at two levels – one being statistics at a global level, and the other being employee statistics at an organizational level. The intention here was to highlight how prevalent mental health struggles are across the world, as well as talk about how it is impacting employees. I also thought it would be important to tie the global and organizational storylines with a more personal story like that of the protagonist Emily.

 Following the interviews following Part II, I was able to make a few improvements in the structure of the narrative. Earlier, the story repeatedly zoomed in and out of the global and personal perspectives. That made the story feel entirely disjoint. For the final presentation, I chose to start with the personal story to draw the audience in, then speak about the global perspective, and then zoom into the organizational level. This helped streamline the story and enabled the visualizations to speak for themselves and build up to a conclusion that was compelling and made sense.
 
I changed the title of the story in order to highlight the key issue at hand – that speaking about mental health at the workplace indeed is a balancing act. It can be challenging being vulnerable in the professional environment, however, it is also necessary in order to foster engagement and a positive work culture. Maintaining an open environment is also crucial for organizations to maintain and foster employee productivity at large, as is evident in the data. 

I cleaned up the visualizations, included citations for data and image sources, and included a takeaway for the audience at the very end. My target audience was students who expect to graduate and enter the workforce soon. I wanted to drive home that awareness and open conversation start right here – and that being supportive to peers and colleagues right where we are can be of tremendous value in their journey.
